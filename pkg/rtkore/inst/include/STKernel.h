/** @defgroup STKernel Kernel tools
 *  @brief The STKernel project is the low-level core library that forms the
 *  basis of the project. It provides data class handling for C++.
 *  It contains the sub-projects:
 *  - @ref Base
 *  - @ref Functors
 **/

/** @ingroup STKernel
 *  @defgroup Base Fundamental data types
 *  @brief In this subproject we define the fundamental types.
 *  The Base subproject is composed of
 * <ul>
 * <li> the standard types for handling data:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> String  for string data  </li>
 *   <li> Integer for discrete data </li>
 *   <li> Real    for quantitative data  </li>
 *   <li> Binary  for binary data in {0,1}   </li>
 *   <li> Sign    for signed data in {-1, 1}  </li>
 *   <li> Range   for contiguous range of Index in Arrays  </li>
 * </ul>
 * For all these types, a not available special value is defined which can be
 * displayed in a transparent way using proxy classes @sa Proxy, @sa Proxy.
 * <li> standard input and output streams for all these types </li>
 * <li> a standard Runtime-type identification mechanism (RTTI) @sa IdType,
 * @sa IdTypeImpl </li>
 * <li> and miscellaneous utilities functions </li>
 * </ul>
 **/

/** @ingroup STKernel
 *  @defgroup Functors Functors
 *  In the Functors subproject, we implement the main functors that can be used
 *  throughout the STK++ project, especially in the Arrays project.

/** @file Sdk.h
 *  @brief This file include all the other header files of the project Sdk.
 *
 * @defgroup Sdk Software Development Kit.
 * @brief The Sdk project propose a set of high level interfaces, template for
 * meta-programming and macros that are used throughout the STK++ projects.
 *
 * In Sdk we define the pure Interface classes than can be used throughout the
 * STK++ whole project. The aim is to unified the syntax and the treatment
 * realized by the statistical methods.
 **/
/** @ingroup Sdk
 *  @defgroup Arithmetic Arithmetic properties.
 *
 *  These classes extend the @c numeric_limits C++ struct. They
 *  allow to handle in a transparent way a possible
 *  Not Available (NA) value in the data.
 **/
/** @ingroup Sdk
 *  @defgroup RTTI Runtime Type Identification.
 *
 *  These classes allow to handle the Runtime type identification (RTTI)
 *  problem and are useful when working with heterogeneous data.
 **/
/** @ingroup Sdk
 *  @defgroup iostream I/O stream declarations
 *
 *  Nearly all of the I/O classes are parameterized on the type of
 *  characters they read and write (The major exception is ios_base at
 *  the top of the hierarchy).
 *
 *  For ease of use, all of the basic_* I/O-related
 *  classes are given typedef names in the namespace STK. For example:
 *
 *  @code
 *     typedef basic_ifstream<Char>  ifstream;
 *  @endcode
 *  These declarations in the STK namespace would be very useful if you
 *  modify the built-in type representation of Char (say wchar_t).
 **/


/** @ingroup Sdk
 *  @namespace STK::Base
 *  @brief the namespace Base contain all the internal stuff needed by the STK++
 *  fundamental types.
